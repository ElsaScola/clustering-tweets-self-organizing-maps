That’s the difference",

@DontrellChillis Ball was still live so ain’t no late hit and you can clearly see him throw his hands out in front to throw Jacobs back,
"@mikejpirie In the first half I didn't think the midfield managed to get the ball out to GMS and McGonn enough either. You don't expect Cosgrove to score, but he didn't think he brought anyone into play either.",

"@cgalicki06 @mbeck35 Ball State finished 5th in the MAC West division, and Vandy finished 6th in the SEC East....so....your statement actually couldn’t be more wrong. They both finished way worse than they were “at the time”",
@EmeryGunners @arseblagger He definitely changed the course of the game. His running off the ball caused them problems,
@WindyCOYS @sikundermalik @jimmyhedge Again rubbish you can't in a million years know Jan thoughts why do he won the ball the Arsenal player wasn't going to get it so why intentionally give away a foul know he was already booked He wasn't late in get the ball,

We are too careless . Losing the ball too much.,

@MENCKelly Not sure. He was influential for lukakus with the ball to rashford (the only mf who can play that pass and appreciate the sought of it) and I think he played the ball again to rashford for herreras (may be wrong though). And that's where Utd are desperate. Quick fwd passes,
Playing against Liverpool you don’t lose the ball in the third half of the pitch.,
Can we give the ball away,
We can’t pass a fuckin ball us to one of our own sort it out putting them on the attack all the time,

@MENCKelly Not sure. He was influential for lukakus with the ball to rashford (the only mf who can play that pass and appreciate the sought of it) and I think he played the ball again to rashford for herreras (may be wrong though). And that's where Utd are desperate. Quick fwd passes,
Playing against Liverpool you don’t lose the ball in the third half of the pitch.,

@MullinsHood Usually I don’t agree with him but anyone who denies the weak schedule is only fooling themselves. Hopefully it does not impact the team negatively when the good competition shows up in league play. Other then “hero” ball I don’t see much improvement from the seasons start.,

"@ChelseaFC We need to press the ball when we lose it, this is what did in our 3 first games of the season.
Now I don't know if we can stand before Man City...get the ball back as soon as possible!",
Midfield issues here. We just can’t get that ball to the strikers in good positions regularly. #lfc #YNWA,
@BarstoolIrish What’s your excuse for beating Ball State by 8 and Pitt by 5?,

@iim_riskyy @PFF_Steve Running 19 mph lol it’s not that easy especially since you have to keep your eye on the ball. You can lay someone out and I’m fine with that but when it turns into headshots is where it gets dangerous,

What is the rule here. A girl is shooting the second of a 2 shot FT. She dribbles the ball off her foot and it rolls away from her. Is this a violation or does she just get to do the FT again?,
"Aaron Ramsey with a game changing two assists in that second half for Arsenal. Baffling as to why the club  have refused to give him a new contract. Exactly the sort of ball playing midfielder I would love at United...

"Said it last week and will say it again.  If you're not scoring any points, at least get the ball in the hands of your most explosive players.  Robby, Quincy and Cannon should get some opportunities.  Most likely scenario, the combine for 5-6 touches.",

@sbnumb3 Same he will be fine in college the real thing is what Lavar pulled gunna make him ineligible to play. Technically he shouldn’t be playing hs ball,
Gini never plays a ball forward and when he does it’s less than 5 yards.,
"@ltarsenal Xhaka looked so composed. I think he's starting to learn his weakness (turning/dribbling with the ball at feet) but effectively compensate for it with an incisive pass. He was immense, didn't put a foot wrong aside from the yellow",
We’ve lost the fuckin plot here. We shit it an panic when we’ve got possession. Keep givin the ball away cheaply an makin it too easy for them. #LIVEVE,
I am here for Andy Robertson running through brick walls to get to the ball,
"@sportscaddy @StereoSerieA I take back what I’ve said about him. He’s a great destroyer in middle of the park. It also allows others to get forward knowing he can clean up a counter attack. As long as he keeps his time on the ball minimal and is positionally sound, he’s great.",

Forgot to tweet this earlier but my dad said that Arfield should not have been sent off as the goalie was not in control of the ball as the goalie was over the goal line and the ball wasn’t I asked him if it happened to McGregor would he say the same he said nothing,
@sarahkendrew @SteveBurke2000 @glarbarbarb I think this upcoming session we might have a shot at getting the ball rolling. I believe @Zeke_Cohen @SenBillFerg @BELBaltimore @RobbynLewis46th know we can't let the state bus network be the only one at this point. I'd reach out to them &amp, @bikemorebmore (more than just bikes!)
Slow start to the second half. A lot of the ball in our own half in the opening moments of the second half as we adapted to those changes. Before that Aubameyang goal. So much to love about that. The ball down the line from Bellerin. The way Ramsey laid it off to Aubameyang,
@timmy_trioti No more passing the fucking ball backwards! Good Riddance Wenger. Onwards and Upwards.,

"@BostinSama @premierleague I’ve been to school with him. Tall, fast and athletic but most of all good with the ball. Still not sure why he isn’t an outfield player though. So he must be very good in goal",
