# Clustering tweets using self organizing maps
Clustering tweets about sports using self-organizing maps.

## Overview
This is my proposal in collaboration with [@julenminer](https://github.com/julenminer) for the application of self-organizing maps to cluster tweets of a speciﬁc topic by different sub-topics and the sentiment associated to them. The main topic chosen for this project is ”sports” and the subtopics are basketball, tennis and football. 

This project consists of two main parts: the code and a report on the project in which the approach is explained in detail.
